# Pygame Animations
This is a collection of Python scripts using the Pygame library to create interactive animations. The project aims to demonstrate various animation techniques and provide a starting point for building your own animated applications or games.

## Complex Game
The "complex game" code included in this project is a Pygame application that allows you to explore complex numbers and their transformations visually. It provides an interactive interface where you can input complex numbers and observe the corresponding output based on a given mathematical function.

### Features
- Visualization of complex number transformations.
- Interactive mouse input to display complex numbers and their corresponding outputs.
- Vector field representation of complex numbers.
- Grid lines for better visualization.
- Adjustable scale for changing the distance between points.
- Keyboard shortcuts for controlling the application.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python (version 3.6 or above)
